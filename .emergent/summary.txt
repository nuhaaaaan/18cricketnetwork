The user's primary language is English. Future responses should be in English.

The trajectory details the development of a comprehensive full-stack mobile application, the 18 Cricket Network. The project started from a PDF specification and evolved through multiple iterative feature requests from the user.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Features (Messages 1-79)**
The initial goal was to build a multi-faceted cricket platform. The AI engineer set up a FastAPI backend and an Expo (React Native) frontend. Key actions included:
- Installing dependencies (, , etc.).
- Scaffolding a complete backend in  with models for Users, Products, Academies, Tournaments, etc., and API endpoints for auth, CRUD operations.
- Building a multi-tab frontend using , including authentication, home, marketplace, and profile screens.
- Integrating Razorpay for payments and adding test data to the database.
- Documenting setup in  and .

**Phase 2: UI/UX Transformation (Messages 80-101)**
The user requested an Instagram-like UI. The AI engineer responded by:
- Redesigning the main tab screens (, , , ) with a visual-first, dark-theme layout.
- Updating the main tab layout and welcome screen to reflect the new aesthetic.

**Phase 3: Advanced Social & Platform Features (Messages 102-153)**
The user requested numerous advanced features. The AI implemented these by:
- Adding backend models and API routes for reels, comments, DMs, squads (groups), live streaming, ground bookings, and vendor commissions.
- Creating new frontend screens for Reels, Comments, and DMs.
- Updating the UI to include buttons for new social actions (reels, messages, sharing).
- Implementing a Nike-like premium brand identity, including a new color scheme and creating a  file.

**Phase 4: Product Design System & Final Theming (Messages 154-157)**
The user provided a highly detailed product design brief.
- The AI generated an exhaustive design system document covering brand identity, logo concepts, typography, components, and information architecture for both mobile and web.
- Immediately after, the user provided a final logo and instructed the AI to theme the application based on it.
- The last action was acknowledging this request and preparing to implement the new theme.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build the 18 Cricket Network, a global, cricket-centric social commerce platform for both mobile (iOS/Android) and web.

**Core Pillars:**
1.  **Social Media:** An Instagram/Nike-like experience with a feed for posts, a dedicated full-screen Reels section, stories, and user profiles. Social features include DMs, group chats (up to 100 members), and a Squad system for friending. Extensive sharing capabilities (internal and external) are required for all content types.
2.  **Marketplace (18 Cricket Company):** A premium, cricket-only e-commerce store. Categories include equipment, specialized nutrition, and services from trainers, physios, and doctors. Vendors can list their products and services.
3.  **Bookings & Facilities:** Users can find, book, and pay for nearby cricket grounds, practice nets, and gyms. Facility owners can list their properties with details like pricing and time slots.
4.  **Live Streaming & Search:** The platform must support live streaming of matches from multiple broadcasters. A powerful search function is needed to find players, verified profiles (teams, cricketers), stores, grounds, and content.

**Brand & Design:**
The aesthetic should be premium, futuristic, and clean, similar to Nike or Apple. The UI must be themed around the provided 18 Cricket Network logo, which has a red, black, and silver color scheme. The platform motto is A tribute to the legacy of THE KING.

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with  and  directories.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key File Summaries:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the heart of the backend. It defines all API endpoints, data models (using Pydantic ), database connections (MongoDB with ), and business logic.
    -   **Changes:** Initially created as a basic server, it has been extensively modified to include models and CRUD operations for users, auth (JWT), products, academies, tournaments, grounds, posts, comments, likes, messages, squads, live streams, and bookings with commission logic.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the root layout file for . It wraps the entire application and is used for setting up global providers, such as state management () and navigation structure.
    -   **Changes:** Created to establish the root stack navigator, which conditionally renders the authentication flow or the main app (tabs) based on the user's login state from the .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file defines the main bottom tab navigation for the authenticated user experience. It configures the tabs (Home, Social, Marketplace, Profile) and their icons.
    -   **Changes:** Created and later updated to include icons and styling for the Instagram-like UI redesign. It's a central piece of the app's navigation.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main landing screen after a user logs in. It is intended to display the primary social feed.
    -   **Changes:** Initially a placeholder, it was completely rewritten to feature an Instagram-like UI with a header for stories, a logo, and icons for messages/notifications. It now includes placeholders for social posts.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages global authentication state using . It holds the user's token and profile information, and provides actions for login and logout.
    -   **Changes:** Created to provide a centralized and persistent way to manage user sessions across the entire application, driving the logic in .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A centralized file to define the application's color palette. This allows for easy and consistent theming.
    -   **Changes:** Created and then updated to reflect the Nike-like premium brand colors (deep navy, gold, etc.). It is the target for the next UI theme update.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Full UI Implementation:** The comprehensive product design system (Message 155) has been generated but not yet implemented. This includes:
  -   Implementing all specified component styles (cards, inputs, buttons).
  -   Building out the dashboard UIs for Vendors, Ground Owners, and Admins.
  -   Implementing features like Stories, Highlights, Archiving, and the advanced search UI with verified badges.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the project's direction pivoted. The previous AI engineer had just finished generating an extensive product and design system document (Message 155) based on a detailed Nike-like prompt from the user (Message 154).

However, the user's very next action (Message 156) was to upload a specific logo for 18 Cricket Network and issue a direct command: **Use this logo for the app and website , generate the UI theme with this logo**.

The AI engineer's final action (Message 157) was to acknowledge this new, superseding request. It analyzed the new logo's aesthetic (bold red, black, metallic silver) and confirmed its next task would be to transform the entire application's color scheme and UI to match this new brand identity. The work was paused just as this theming task was about to begin. The core logic and features from the Nike-like phase are still relevant, but the visual layer is now being re-evaluated based on the new logo.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update the  file to reflect the new brand identity (red, black, silver) derived from the provided logo, and begin applying this new theme to the main application layouts.
