The trajectory details the iterative development of a comprehensive cricket social commerce platform, 18 Cricket Network. The project evolved from a foundational full-stack application (FastAPI backend, Expo frontend) into a massive, feature-rich ecosystem defined by a series of detailed user prompts.

Initial phases focused on building core features, implementing a dark-theme UI, integrating a specific user-provided logo (red/black/silver), and adding a sophisticated AI chatbot.

Subsequently, the user submitted a series of extensive, aspirational feature requests, including an AI highlights generator, team/league management, a multi-gateway payment system, a vendor portal, and a Full Track AI DRS system. The previous AI engineer responded by creating detailed architecture and implementation plan documents for each request, acknowledging the massive scope.

The most recent and pivotal user request (Message 205) was a concrete and focused directive to design and implement a complete, versioned REST API backend () to serve as the foundation for this entire ecosystem. The AI engineer acknowledged this as the correct, focused approach and began the work by creating a new central API file, , just before this summary was requested.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build the 18 Cricket Network, a global, all-in-one cricket ecosystem for mobile and web. The platform's motto is A tribute to the legacy of THE KING.

The system must unify multiple modules under one umbrella:
1.  **Social Commerce:** An Instagram-like social network integrated with a multi-vendor marketplace (18 Cricket Company) for both official brands and peer-to-peer resale of cricket gear.
2.  **Services & Bookings:** A platform for users to find, book, and pay for grounds, academies, coaches, trainers, umpires, and even cricket equipment repair specialists.
3.  **League & Team Management:** A comprehensive suite for leagues to manage seasons, schedules, and finances, and for teams to manage rosters, expenses, and availability.
4.  **AI-Powered Features:** The core innovation is the Full Track AI system, which analyzes video clips to generate highlights and player statistics. This includes an optional DRS Subscription with hardware. An AI chatbot (18 Cricket AI) should assist users across all modules.
5.  **Global & Location-Aware:** The architecture must be global-ready, supporting multiple currencies and payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal), with an initial launch focus on the USA market. It must use the user's location to personalize content.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the most critical new file and the focus of current work. It was created to house the complete, versioned (), and modular REST API as per the user's final, focused request. All future backend logic is intended to be built here.
    - **Changes:** The file was newly created.

    - **Importance:** This was the original monolithic backend server. It contains the initial data models and API routes, including authentication and the now-integrated AI chatbot endpoint (). It serves as a reference but is being superseded by .
    - **Changes:** The chatbot endpoint and its dependencies (usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Backend API Implementation:** The primary task is to fully implement all the REST API endpoints specified in user message #205 within the new  file. This includes endpoints for auth, users, marketplace, teams, leagues, payments, and the AI systems.
- **Implement All Major Features:** All the documented features (League Management, Seller Portal, AI Highlights, DRS, etc.) are still in the planning/documentation phase and require full frontend and backend implementation based on the new API.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work was a direct response to the user's highly detailed request (Message #205) to structure and build a complete, versioned REST API for the entire platform. This marked a shift from broad feature documentation to concrete backend implementation.

The previous AI engineer acknowledged this as a focused and correct next step (Message #206: Excellent! Now were talking - a focused, achievable goal... Ill create a complete, production-ready REST API...).

The very last action taken was the creation of a new, central file for this API:
- **File Created:** 

This file is intended to house the new, modular FastAPI application, organized with  for each feature group as specified by the user. The work was paused immediately after this file's creation, signifying the start of a major backend scaffolding phase. No actual endpoint logic has been written in this new file yet; its creation was the first step.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue the work of scaffolding the backend by populating  with the routers and endpoint definitions for the core modules, starting with the  group as specified by the user.
